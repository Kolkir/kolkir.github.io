I've published my camera calibration tool. It is simple tool based on
OpenCV library with UI implemented with FLTK. It allow create and print
checkerboard patters with different sizes. Preview calibration images.
Save calibration results to the file. But it doesn't support
undistortion now. It can be compiled for the Linux but CMake scripts
should be little updated.
