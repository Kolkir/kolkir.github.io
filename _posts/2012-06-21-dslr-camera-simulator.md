I have and idea to create DSLR camera simulator. It should be an
application where user can add different objects to scene and light
sources (for example soft boxes), then move and rotate them. Also there
should be a camera, which user will move too. Camera settings should be
changeable. Also all of this should be presented in 3D mode. And the
main feature will be ray-tracing module which will make rendering
according to the camera settings. Main goal of application will allow
user to play with light and DOF. I think that ray-tracing will be
without material settings and textures.
