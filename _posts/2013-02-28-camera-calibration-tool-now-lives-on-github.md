Camera Calibration Tool sources now lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/Kolkir/calib). I'm now updating this tool to use
it with my scanner project so it will have some new features:

1.  Undistorted photo preview
2.  Measuring camera sensor size (with known focal length)
3.  Measuring camera focal length (with known sensor size)
