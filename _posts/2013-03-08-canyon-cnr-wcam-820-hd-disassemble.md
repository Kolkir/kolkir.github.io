To continue my experiments with my scanner tool, I've need to calibrate
my web camera Canyon CNR-WCAM 820 HD. I've disassembled camera to
measure sensor size, it has 4mm width and 2.5mm height. Also I've found
problems with poorly soldered elements (see sensor photo), and using
sticky tape for compactors.
